# blood-pressure-simulator

This project is divided into two apps (Blood Pressure Meter Simulator and Blood Pressure Meter - https://github.com/amoferreira/blood-pressure-meter). This repo corresponds to the Blood Pressure Simulator, which is an app that generates a QR code with information on the systolic and diastolic pressures and heart rate values inserted by the user.

This project was developed under the scope of the curricular unit Mobile Computing in Biomedical Engineering in the 2nd year of the master in Bioengineering (2021).
